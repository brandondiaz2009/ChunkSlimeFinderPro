# ChunkSlimeFinderPro
App to find massive chunks together in Minecraft

Edit file for put your coords, then they will find nearastet you the massive chunks:

seedInput = put you seed

You coords there
int x = 0, y = 0; // Corrdenadas iniciales

How max steps app do for search chunks (0 = infinite to get the first chunk)
int input = 0; // Total de saltos 0 = infinito


For each chunk search near there more smile chunks
int totalStepsNear = 8; // Default 8 = 3x3 // 24 for 5x5 chunks

How many chunks you want find in "nearet" chunk
int totalSlimesNear = 8; // Cantidad de chhunks cerca en los pasos

**More chunks decrese de rate of near of you, 3 chunks = very near, 10x10 slime chunks is possible to get coors of 1 million+
